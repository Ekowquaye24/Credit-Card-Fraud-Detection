# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

##	Introduction
This project leverages machine learning to tackle the pervasive problem of credit card fraud. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of credit card transactions, we develop and evaluate models capable of distinguishing between fraudulent and legitimate transactions with high accuracy. Our approach is rooted in rigorous data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the application of several advanced machine learning techniques.

## 	Project Highlights
*	Comprehensive Data Analysis: Initial exploration of the dataset to understand the characteristics of fraudulent transactions.
*	Innovative Solutions to Imbalance: Implementation of ROS and RUS to effectively balance the dataset, enhancing model performance.
*	Advanced Modeling Techniques: Comparative analysis of multiple models including Random Forest, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Tree.
*	In-depth Model Evaluation: Utilization of ROC curves and AUC metrics to identify the most effective model.
*	Impactful Findings: Insightful variable importance analysis to identify key predictors of fraud.

##	Technologies and Tools
*	Programming Language: R
*	Libraries: randomForest, e1071, gbm, rpart, pROC, dplyr, caret, ROSE, ggplot2, caTools, tidyverse

##	Results

The Random Forest model demonstrated superior performance, achieving an AUC of 100\% and accuracy of 99.98\%, with sensitivity and specificity values highlighting its effectiveness in fraud detection.

##	Future Work
*	Model Improvement: Explore additional techniques to further enhance model accuracy.
*	Real-time Detection: Implement the model in a real-time fraud detection system.
*	Feature Engineering: Investigate the creation of new features to improve model performance.
